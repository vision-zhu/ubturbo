## 🔜 Roadmap

See the [**Roadmap**](docs/roadmap.md) for UBTurbo's roadmap and release plans.

## 🎉 Overview

UBTurbo is an open-source in-node resource management framework for openEuler aarch64 servers. Its design goals
and core principles are:

- **Unified foundation**: the daemon provides configuration, logging, lifecycle, plugin management, and in-node
  communication facilities.
- **Plugin-based resource capabilities**: components such as RMRS and UCache are loaded as shared libraries on
  demand, allowing business capabilities and the framework to evolve independently.
- **Coordinated tiered-memory scheduling**: RMRS migration decisions are combined with SMAP page scanning and
  migration to manage local and remote NUMA memory.

![UBTurbo architecture](docs/images/ubturbo-architecture.svg)

As illustrated above, UBTurbo consists primarily of the following modules:

- **Client SDK**: exposes `libubturbo_client.so` to external processes and handles request serialization and result
  parsing.
- **IPC**: receives in-node requests over Unix Domain Sockets and dispatches service names to registered handlers.
- **Plugin Manager**: reads the plugin admission configuration and manages plugin lifecycles through `dlopen` and
  `dlclose`.
- **Config & Log**: provides unified configuration loading and leveled logging to the daemon and plugins.
- **RMRS**: generates and executes memory migration decisions for virtual-machine and container scenarios.
- **SMAP**: identifies hot and cold pages through user-space policies and kernel modules, then performs page
  migration.
- **UCache & UBDMA**: provide process Page Cache ratio control and DMA page-migration extensions, respectively.

In a typical scenario, a cluster resource manager sends a local-memory migration request to RMRS through the Client
SDK. RMRS determines how much memory to migrate for the target process from the current resource state, then invokes
SMAP to scan and migrate pages. UBTurbo manages configuration, logging, service registration, and process lifecycle
throughout the operation.

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Plugin-based resource management**

  UBTurbo discovers and loads shared libraries according to `ubturbo_plugin_admission.conf`. Plugins use common
  entry points for initialization, IPC service registration, and resource cleanup, and can be developed, deployed,
  and evolved without changing the daemon's responsibilities.
- **Reliable in-node communication**

  The Client SDK invokes services registered by the daemon and its plugins over UDS. The server decodes requests,
  locates services, calls handlers, and returns results. It does not listen on a network port; access is bounded by
  local accounts, groups, and socket-file permissions.
- **Tiered-memory scanning and migration**

  SMAP identifies page temperature and migrates pages between local or remote NUMA nodes. `pageType=0` selects 4K
  page mode, while `pageType=1` selects 2M page mode. RMRS can migrate out, migrate back, or roll back memory based
  on capacity, page temperature, and business constraints.
- **Shared infrastructure**

  The framework starts Security, configuration, logging, SMAP, plugins, and IPC in dependency order and releases
  them during shutdown. The daemon and plugins reuse asynchronous logging, configuration loading, and the Client
  SDK, reducing duplicate implementations.

## 🔥 Performance Testing

See the [SMAP Performance Testing Guide](docs/smap/performance_testing.md) for the test environment, methodology,
metrics, and report fields.
