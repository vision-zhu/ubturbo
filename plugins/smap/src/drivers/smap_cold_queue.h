 * Description: Per-node PFN queue for cold page swap-out
 *
 * Lock-free MPSC ring buffer.  During the scan phase (producers only),
 * enqueue claims a slot via atomic_fetch_add(&tail) and commits via
 * atomic_inc(&count) after the PFN is written.  During the drain phase
 * (single consumer, after all producers have quiesced), the consumer
 * reads count and walks head..head+count.  No global lock — per-node
 * tail and count are the only shared state.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The consumer MUST NOT run concurrently with producers.
 * In the current architecture this is guaranteed by userspace: the
 * drain ioctl (SMAP_MIG_DRAIN_COLD_QUEUE) is issued only after all
 * scan ioctls have returned.
